1. Unpack the "Step_1_CoreResources" package, it will add all core resources (textures, scripts, and animations) needed for this Asset.

2. After that, pick the right SRP package and unpack it too. It will add all other components like prefabs of complete effects, scenes, materials, and shaders. 

3. If you using URP make sure, you enable HDR, Depth and Opaque textures in URP Asset settings.

4. If you using Standard pipeline and already have PostProcessing Stack V2 in your project, you can uncheck it when unpacking the Standard package.

5. For better visual results use Linear Rendering instead of Gamma. You can choose it in a "Project Settings/Player" menu
