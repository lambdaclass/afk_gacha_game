Many Particle Effects parameters are controlled via Custom Vertex Streams. Such parameters like Emission Power, Dissolve Progress,
Appear and Disappear, Random Offset for Noise Textures, and etc. Check the name of a shader used in the Particle System, find it on
this page, and check what each Custom Vertex Stream does. Try to modify, for example, the Dissolve Progress parameter for the
“DissolveParticleAdvanced” shader and make particles disappear quicker or slower.

DissolveParticleSimple:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Random value for adjusting offset of the Main Texture
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Random value for adjusting scale of the Main Texture
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve progress, used to control the dissolve effect
Custom1.W / UV1.Y - Random value for flipbook frames


DissolveParticleAdvanced:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Random value for each particle, to make them look slightly different
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Distortion Power Multiplier, used to control texture distortion over lifetime
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve progress, used to control the dissolve effect
Custom1.W / UV1.Y - Emission Multiplier, control the emission power over lifetime
Custom2.X / UV1.Z - Secondary Mask offset, used to multiply opacity by moving this mask texture with Vertex Streams
Custom2.Y / UV1.W - Secondary Mask negate, use this to control how much Second Mask affecting opacity
ustom2.Z / UV2.X - Distortion Mask offset, used to multiply distortion by moving this mask texture with Vertex Streams


DissolveParticleDepth:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Emission Multiplier, control the emission power over the lifetime
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Offset and Dissolve Progress, this parameter will affect both the dissolve and offset parameters
Size / UV1.X - Adjusting the scale multiplier depending on particle size (No need to modify this parameter, it is a fix)


DissolveParticleGroundPacked:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Random value for each particle, to make them look slightly different
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Secondary Mask (Appear/Initialize) progress, use this to make effect appear
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve progress, used to control the dissolve effect
Custom1.W / UV1.Y - Emission Multiplier, control the emission power over lifetime
Custom2.X / UV1.Z - Lava Appear progress, control the appearence of lava


FakeTrailAndMeshFireParticles:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Control the U gradient mask, used for fade in and fade out effects of the fire
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Custom UV offset animation, moving the whole fire mask texture, used to make moving fire trail look more realistic
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Random value for each particle, to make them look slightly different


DissolveParticleMV / DissolveParticleFlipBook:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Random value for each particle, to make them look slightly different
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Distortion Power Multiplier, used to control texture distortion over lifetime
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve progress, used to control the dissolve effect
Custom1.W / UV1.Y - Emission Multiplier, control the emission power over lifetime
Custom2.X / UV1.Z - Secondary Mask offset, used to multiply opacity by moving this mask texture with Vertex Streams
Custom2.Y / UV1.W - Secondary Mask negate, use this to control how much Second Mask affecting opacity
Custom2.Z / UV2.X - Distortion Mask offset, used to multiply distortion by moving this mask texture with Vertex Streams
Custom2.W / UV2.Y - Custom frame animation control for a flipbook texture, enable “MV Particle Frame Control Enabled” parameter in material settings to use this Vertex Stream.


CenterCurve:

Custom1.X / UV0.Z - Random value for each particle, to make them look slightly different
Custom1.Y / UV0.W - Emission Multiplier, control the emission power over lifetime
Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve progress, used to control the dissolve effect
Custom1.W / UV1.Y - Second Mask offset progress, used to move the second mask on V coordinate


Props:

Custom1.Z / UV1.X - Dissolve/Appear Effect progress control. Used to control the dissolve effect of the mesh when it appears or disappears.
