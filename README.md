## Suggested Development Environment

Set up your environment with the following steps:

- Download the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.403-macos-arm64-installer) for your operating system.
- In VSCode, download the .NET extension. After installation, change the version to 1.26 (locate the version dropdown next to the Uninstall button in the extension window).
- To check if the setup is successful, go to VSCode's console, select the Output tab, and pick Omnisharp Log in the dropdown. If there are no error logs and Omnisharp is scanning the project, the configuration is correct.
- Run `make setup` to install the necessary dependencies to format and lint the code.
- Add dotnet-format to your PATH by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cat << \EOF >> ~/.zprofile
# Add .NET Core SDK tools
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/$USER/.dotnet/tools"
EOF
```

## Documentation
### Client Paths

The following diagram outlines the initialization process of a connection between the client and the backend, as well as the retrieval of the user's data to be displayed on the header.

On the start of the application, the SocketConnection, which is a game object in the scene, tries to establish a websocket connection with the backend. Upon successful establishment of the connection, the SocketConnection requests the current user data from the backend (note: the register/login logic is not shown in this diagram).

In parallel, the HeaderManager waits for the user information to be retrieved via the GlobalUserData, which is the class that contains the user information.

Once the user data is retrieved from the backend, it is sent to the HeaderManager, where the relevant information is displayed in the UI. Additionally, the HeaderManager subscribes to updates from the GlobalUserData, ensuring that any changes are promptly reflected in the UI.

The next diagram depicts the actions that take place when a user enters the Summon scene.

When entering the Summon scene, the SummonManager script is responsible of fetching the summon boxes from the backend via the SocketConnection. When these are returned, the manager instantiates a UI element for each box.

The user can then buy one of these boxes, triggering a chain communication that traverses all the way to the backend, passing through currency availability checks first. Once the backend processes the user's request, it returns the summoned unit so the summon manager can display it in the UI.
