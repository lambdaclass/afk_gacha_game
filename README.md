## About

Welcome to the realm of Champions of Mirra, crafted by LambdaClass.

Champions of Mirra is the second game that utilizes our groundbreaking [Game Backend](https://github.com/lambdaclass/game_backend). This open-source backend, meticulously developed by Lambda, ensures seamless and reliable gameplay.

Step into a universe where you, the player, get to turn the tides on an all-out war between the forces of good and evil. Side together with Mirra, the capricious deity known for manipulating entire societies by exploiting their deepest desires, or choose to rebel against its advances instead.

Champions of Mirra is more than a game; it's an adventure into a world where strategy, skill, and a dash of chaos converge. Join the battle and confront the challenges that lie ahead in this captivating and dynamic gaming experience. The stage is set, and the Champions of Kaline await your commandsâ€”embrace the challenge and become a legend!

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Nix:**
You can install the Nix package manager by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
$ curl \
  --proto '=https' \
  --tlsv1.2 \
  -sSf \
  -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix \
  | sh -s -- install
```
The installer will ask you for the sudo password, and then print the details about what steps it will perform to install Nix. You have to accept this to proceed with the installation.

Make sure there weren't any errors during the installation and, if there are none, close the shell and start a new one.

To test if Nix generally works, just run GNU hello or any other package:
```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#hello
Hello, world!
```
